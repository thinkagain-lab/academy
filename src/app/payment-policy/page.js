            The data is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) when processing payment. 
            Your purchase transaction data is only used as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. 
            After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is not saved.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, 
            which is a joint effort of brands like Rupay, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover.

          <p className="mb-4">
            If an enrolment is requested for any Course via the Site, Application or Services, We will either pre-approve, 
            confirm or reject the enrolment request within the period of 7 days from the date of the request for enrolment 
            ('Enrolment Request Period'), otherwise, the enrolment request will automatically expire. If we are unable to 
            confirm or decide to reject an enrolment request within the Enrolment Request Period, any amounts collected by 
            Think Again Lab for the requested enrolment will be refunded to the concerned Student. When we confirm an enrolment 
            requested by a Student, Think Again Lab will send the Student an email, text message or message via e-mail and the 
            Application confirming such enrolment, depending on the selections you make via the Site, Application and Services.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The Course Fees payable will be displayed to the Student before the Student sends an enrolment request to Think Again Lab.

            amount to Student's Payment Method pursuant to the Payments Terms. If a requested enrolment is canceled (before any confirmations 
            are provided), any amounts collected by Think Again Lab will be refunded to such Student, depending on the selections the Student 
            makes via the Site and Application, and any pre-authorization of Student's Payment Method will be released, if applicable.
